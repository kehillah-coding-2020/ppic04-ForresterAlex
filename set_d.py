4.36 Modify the frequency chart function to draw wide bars instead of
lines.

"""
4.37* Modify the frequency chart function so that the range of the x axis
is not tightly bound to the number of data items in the list but
rather uses some minimum and maximum values.
"""



"""
4.38* Another way to compute the frequency table is to obtain a list of
key-value pairs using the `items` method. This list of tuples can be
sorted and printed without returning to the original dictionary.
Reqrite the frequency table function using this idea.
"""



"""
4.39* A good programming practice is to take a step back and look at your
code and to factor out the parts that you have reused into separate
functions. This is the case with our `frequencyTable()` function.
Modify `frequencyTable()` so that it returns the dictionary of
frequency counts it creates.
"""



"""
4.40* Now write a separate function to print the frequency table using the
dictionary created by the `frequencyTable()` function in the previous
problem.
"""



"""
4.41* Modify `frequencyChart()` from listing 4.10 to use the new
`frequencyTable()` function.
"""



"""
4.42 Modify the frequency chart function to include a graphical
representation of the mean.
"""



"""
4.43 Modify the frequency chart function to draw a line representing plus
or minus 1 standard deviation from the mean.

4.44 Using `random.uniform`, generate a list of 1,000 numbers in the range
0-50. Graph the frequency distribution along with the mean and
standard deviation.
